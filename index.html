            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Henry Lawson (1867–1922) was one of Australia's most iconic poets and short story writers. Born in Grenfell, New South Wales, he is best known for his depictions of bush life and the struggles of the working class. Partially deaf from a young age, Lawson’s unique voice captured the hardships and spirit of rural Australia during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
